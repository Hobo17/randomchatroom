  <p>
  This started as a social experiment as part of a guest lecture at an esteemed institute of learning and will continue as a social experiment.</p>
 
  <p>It was set up as a way for those people in the audience to ask questions who were too shy.  This was the beginning of the madness.</p>

  <p>If you want to help develop the madness (you don't have to be a coder), join the google group at <a
    href="http://groups.google.com/group/randomchatroom">http://groups.google.com/group/randomchatroom</a> . It will be a fun learning experience at the very least.</p>
